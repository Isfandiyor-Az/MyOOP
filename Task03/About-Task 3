Write a program to calculate tax, given the following conditions: 

If salary is less than 2000 USD then no tax will be zero. 
If salary is in the range of 2001 to 3000 USD (2001<=salary<3000) then tax will be charged with rate of 20%. 
If salary is in the range of 3001 to 5000 USD (3001<=salary<5000) then tax will be charged with rate of 30%. S
If taxable income is above 5000 then tax will be charged with rate of 40%.

Exe 3
A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions: 
a. Hardness must be greater than 50. 
b. Carbon content must be less than 0.7. 
c. Tensile strength must be greater than 5600. 

The grades are as follows: 
If all three conditions are satisfied then Grade will be 10. 
If condition (a) and (b ) are satisfied then Grade will be 9. 
If conditions (b) and ( c) are satisfied then Grade will be 8. 
If conditions (a) and (c) are satisfied then Grade will be 7. 
If any one condition is satisfied then Grade will be 6. 
If none of the conditions are satisfied then Grade will be 5. 
Write a program which will require the user to input values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel and print the grade of steel according to the given conditions.
