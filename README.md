# C++ Tasks and Labs 🚀

This repository contains various C++ tasks and labs, each organized into separate folders for better structure and clarity. Each task folder includes:

- **C++ code files** (`.c++`) 📄: Contains the implementation of the respective task or lab.
- **Description files** (`About-Task*`) 📝: Provides details about the task or lab.
- **Supporting files** 📷: Images or other resources used in the tasks (if applicable).

## Folder Structure 📂

- **Task 1**
  - `About-Task 1` 📝: Description of Task 1.
  - `lab1.c++` 📄: Source code for Task 1.

- **Task 2**
  - `About-Task 2` 📝: Description of Task 2.
  - `image.png` 📷: Supporting image for Task 2.
  - `lab2.c++` 📄: Source code for Task 2.
