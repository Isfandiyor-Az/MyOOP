Exe 1
The process of finding the largest number is used frequently in computer applications. For example, a program that determines the winner of a sales contest inputs the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest. Write a C++ program that uses a for statement to determine and print the largest number of 10 numbers input by the user. 
Your program should use three variables, as follows:
counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have
been input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed).
number: The current number input to the program.
largest: The largest number found so far.
