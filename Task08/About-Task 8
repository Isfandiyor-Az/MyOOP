Exe 1
Write a complete C++ program with the two alternate functions specified below,
each of which simply triples the variable count defined in main. These two functions are
a) function tripleByValue that passes a copy of count by value, triples the copy and
returns the new value and
b) function tripleByReference that passes count by reference via a reference parameter and
triples the original value of count through its alias (i.e., the reference parameter).

Exe 2
Create a function that takes a range of numbers and returns the sum of the digits of the first and last numbers in the range.
(Hint: digitsSum(1, 11) âžž 48
total numbers in the range are = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
sum of each digits is = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 +0+1+1 = 48 )

Exe 3
Find G.C.D for two integers using recursion
(Hint:  The greatest common divisor of 12 and 26 can be calculated as:
Divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
Divisors of 26 are 1, 2, 13, and 26.
Common divisors of 12 and 26 are 1 and 2.
The greatest common divisor of (12, 26) is 2.)
